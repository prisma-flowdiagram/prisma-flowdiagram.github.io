					<p>Data will be extracted from the articles and entered onto an electronic spreadsheet which will be initially piloted.  A proportion of texts will be examined by a second reviewer, who will extract data using the same electronic spreadsheet. The data to be extracted will include year of publication, authors, country, type of source (whether itâ€™s a policy/ a study/ a guideline), purpose/objective of the article, sample characteristics for studies (victims of IPV and ambulance clinicians), the method used (interview, survey etc.), outcome data (including: how ambulance clinicians identify and manage male victims of IPV; what experiences ambulance clinicians have of responding to male victims of IPV; and outcomes of incidents) or policy (or other) guidance (including how ambulance clinicians identify, manage and respond to male victims of IPV).  All authors will review the data extraction to ensure there is consistency between reviewers.</p>

					<p>The data extracted will depend on the publication type. For primary research, reviews or other writing of empirical studies, data extracted will include: demographic data, population details, methodology, and outcome data that relates to either:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Identification of victims</li>
						<li>Management of victims; or</li>
						<li>Experiences of ambulance clinicians in relation to victims of IPV</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For policy papers, data extracted will include: country of origin, target audience details, sector details, guidance or recommendations given.</p>

					<p>As there is no comparator being investigated, and following preliminary reading after the scoping search, it is expected that there will a lack of homogeneity of design across studies. Therefore, a narrative synthesis will likely be completed for this review.  </p>

					<p>The weight of evidence (WoE) framework proposed by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02671520701296189" target="_blank">Gough (2007)</a> will be used to ensure that generic comments on study design (as identified through the quality assessment) can be combined with how well the specific study addresses the research question. This framework will be used to develop the narrative synthesis. Data will be presented in a tabular format for each article, including each of the judgement criteria from the WoE framework. The synthesis will include the number of studies and study characteristics, such as study design, along with a summary of the characteristics of the targeted population (e.g., gender of victims, number and type of ambulance clinicians) and the outcome of the experiences of ambulance clinicians relevant to this review. This will be presented in the text of the review, and tables included where suitable to summarise the information. </p>

					<p>With the anticipation of few papers being found in relation to the primary outcomes, there will be no lower limit on the number of papers to be included; this may result in an empty review, however authors note that this is an important finding in itself. Outcome data to be synthesised relates directly to the research question - how ambulance clinicians identify, manage and respond to male victims of IPV. Where qualitative studies are identified in the review, a meta-aggregative approach will be taken to data synthesis in order to present the themes found across papers.  </p>
